# Permanent URLs for SpatiaLite Windows Binaries

[SpatiaLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/) publishes Windows binaries in http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/windows-bin-amd64/ - but the URLs to those packages change when a new version is released.

If you want to set up automation (e.g. tests in a GitHub Actions Workflow) you need a stable URL.

This repository archives copies of those binary files to provide a stable URL for them.
